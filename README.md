# Moore-Hodgsons Task Scheduler
Uses Moore-Hodgsons' Algorithm to schedule tasks. Modules coded in C++ and used in Python using Pybind11.

Doing this project to practice my C++ and Python workflow.

#### Compiling C++ in CLI
1. Compile C++: `g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name`
2. Run executable: `./file_name`

#### Summary of using Pybind11
1. `cd` into whatever folder you want to build your module
2. Use `cmake <CMakeLists.txt director>` to build module
3. Use `make` to make Python binding
